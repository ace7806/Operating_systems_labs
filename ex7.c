// Using the following rules of the construction site:
// N construction workers are taking turns to move stones.
// There are the same amount of stones as construction workers.
// In order to take turns first any worker moves 2 stones.
// Secondly, a worker that already moved 2 stones can only then move a single stone.
// The only stones that worker A can move are stones A-1, A, and A+1. ('A' being a number greater or equal than 0).
// There are not a stone numbered less than 0 and greater than N.
// The worker can move any random stones near them.
// If a worker has not moved any stone they must wait for two available stones to move at the same time.
// If a worker has already moved their first two stones and there isn't any single stone to move they must wait until there is an available stone.
// Any worker finished their job if they completed the steps previouslyÂ explained.
